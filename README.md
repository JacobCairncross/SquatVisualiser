TODO: 
- [X] Remove angle inputs, now mouse does it. Still need the length inputs though
- [X] Add in onscreen display for all current angles
- [X] make it so the mouse coordinates are relative to the canvas box, not the screen
- [X] inverse the directions of the mouse flow (so up straightens the thigh, and right mvoes the tibia right)
- [X] make the diagram go red when squat becomes dangerous (hips infront of ankle) 
- [X] add in a head and feet
- [] refactor code to be legible
- [] style
- [X] keep rendering latest squat
- [] dockerize (?) and host (!)
